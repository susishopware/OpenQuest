# Data model (ERD)

Status: **draft** — first version for discussion. Target database: PostgreSQL + PostGIS.

The model has four areas:

1. **Open data** — generic assets (trees today, anything with a location tomorrow) and where they come from.
2. **Users** — accounts, roles, credentials.
3. **Quests** — quests, claims, submissions, photos, review.
4. **Write-back & gamification** — attribute changes derived from approved submissions, exports to the city, points and badges.

## Design decisions

### Generic assets instead of a `tree` table

Trees are not modeled as their own table. Every open data object is an **`ASSET`** with a **`ASSET_TYPE`** (`tree`, later `bench`, `playground`, `bike_rack`, …):

- Common fields every object has — location, source, external id, sync state — are real columns.
- Type-specific fields live in `ASSET.attributes` (JSONB) and are validated against `ASSET_TYPE.attribute_schema` (JSON Schema). A new asset type needs **no migration**, only a new `ASSET_TYPE` row and adapter support.
- `ASSET.raw` keeps the untouched source record, so we can re-normalize later without re-downloading.
- `geom` is a PostGIS `geography`. Points today; polygons or lines (e.g. green areas, paths) fit the same column later.
- Frequently filtered attributes can get expression / GIN indexes, e.g. `(attributes->>'genus')`.

Alternative considered: one table per asset type (`tree`, `bench`, …). Rejected because every new data set would need schema changes in core, which contradicts the adapter idea.

### Snapshots and history

Every import is a `SYNC_RUN` (it is the snapshot in the sense of [ADR-0001](../adr/0001-baumkataster-datenbezug-und-rueckkanal.md): `snapshot_id` = `SYNC_RUN.id`, `fetched_at` = `SYNC_RUN.started_at`). History is kept on two levels:

- **Full download:** the unchanged file from the source is stored in object storage (`SYNC_RUN.snapshot_key`). Every snapshot can be reloaded exactly as it was.
- **Changes per asset:** `ASSET_SNAPSHOT` gets a row only when an asset was created, changed (`source_hash` differs) or disappeared at the source. A daily sync of 43k unchanged trees therefore adds no rows, and the state of any asset at any sync can still be reconstructed.

`ASSET` itself always holds the current state. `SYNC_RUN.schema_hash` records the source's field list; if it changes unexpectedly, the run fails loudly instead of importing broken data.

### Where city-specific things live

`DATA_SOURCE` describes one concrete data set of one city and points to the adapter that reads it (`adapter_key`) plus adapter-specific `config`. Core code never branches on city names — see [CLAUDE.md](../../CLAUDE.md).

### One quest = one asset

A quest targets exactly one asset. When an admin creates quests "for all trees in district X", a **`QUEST_CAMPAIGN`** is created and one `QUEST` per matching asset is generated. This keeps `max_completions` unambiguous (per asset) and makes the map simple (one marker per quest).

### Limiting completions (`max_completions`)

- `QUEST.slots_taken` counts active claims plus pending/approved submissions.
- Claiming happens in one transaction: `SELECT … FROM quest WHERE id = $1 FOR UPDATE`, check `slots_taken < max_completions`, insert `CLAIM`, increment `slots_taken`. This prevents two players from taking the last slot at the same time.
- A claim that expires (`expires_at`) or a rejected submission decrements `slots_taken`.
- Constraint: at most one `active` claim per user and quest (partial unique index on `CLAIM(quest_id, user_id) WHERE status = 'active'`).

### Users & passwords

- Only `password_hash` is stored (argon2id). Plain passwords never touch the database or logs.
- **No email address is stored.** Players sign up with username + password only, which keeps the barrier low and avoids personal data. Consequence: there is no password reset via email. Instead, accounts are recovered with **one-time recovery codes** (`USER_RECOVERY_CODE`):
  - At sign-up the player is shown a set of codes once (e.g. 8) and asked to save them. Only their argon2id hashes are stored.
  - With a valid code the player can set a new password. The code is then marked `used_at` and can't be used again.
  - Players can regenerate their codes while logged in; this deletes the old ones.
  - Login and recovery attempts are rate-limited, since codes are the only recovery path.
- `deleted_at` allows GDPR deletion by anonymizing the row while keeping submissions (and the open data they produced) intact.
- Sessions / refresh tokens are left to the auth library we pick and are not modeled here yet.

### From submission to open data

An approved `SUBMISSION` produces `ATTRIBUTE_CHANGE` rows (e.g. `genus: "Baum Amt62" → "Tilia"`, `photo_url: null → …`). We never overwrite `ASSET.attributes` from the city directly with player data — changes are collected and exported via `EXPORT_RUN`, because the city stays the owner of the data. The next sync then brings the city's (possibly updated) values back.

### Points as a ledger

`POINT_TRANSACTION` is append-only; `USER.total_points` is only a cache for fast leaderboards. This makes corrections traceable (e.g. negative amount after a submission is rejected later).

## Münster tree data (`gruen_opendata.csv`)

All sources, licenses and attribution: [data-sources.md](data-sources.md). Source and access are decided in [ADR-0001](../adr/0001-baumkataster-datenbezug-und-rueckkanal.md): the data comes live from the city's WFS (`geo.stadt-muenster.de/mapserv/odgruen_serv`, layer `Baeume`), not from the portal. License dl-de/by-2.0.

Analysis of the CSV export (43,114 rows):

| Column | Example | Meaning | Mapping |
|---|---|---|---|
| `WKT` | `POINT (7.6123466 51.9746341)` | Location, WKT, lon/lat WGS84 | `ASSET.geom` |
| `str_schl` | `02505` | Street key (Straßenschlüssel), 1,067 distinct values, 14 empty | `attributes.street_key` (keep as string, leading zeros!) |
| `baumgruppe` | `Tilia` | Genus (Latin), 74 distinct values | `attributes.genus` |

Findings that affect the model:

- **No id column.** The adapter has to derive a stable `external_id`. On re-sync, points that moved slightly must be matched to the existing asset by nearest neighbour within a small radius (e.g. 1 m), otherwise quests and photos lose their tree. **Question for Stadt Münster:** is there an internal tree number we could get in the export?
  - **Open point, to be settled in ADR-0001:** the ADR hashes coordinate (EPSG:25832, rounded to 0.1 m) + `str_schl` + `baumgruppe`. Including the genus means a tree gets a new id as soon as the city adopts a genus correction made by players, which cuts it off from its quests and photos. Recommendation for OpenQuest: hash the coordinate only.
- **Only the genus, not the species.** Top genera: Tilia 10,279 · Quercus 8,199 · Acer 5,324 · Carpinus 3,448.
- **Unknown / placeholder genus:** 2,832 × `Baum Amt62` and 103 empty values. The adapter normalizes these to `genus = null` (raw value stays in `raw`). These ~2,900 trees are ideal targets for first `verify_attribute` quests.
- Street keys are padded to 5 digits and resolved to street names via the WFS `odstrasseserv`; district and quarter come from the portal's GeoJSON (see ADR-0001, adapter concern).
- The ADR also flags near-duplicates (< 1 m apart) and data quality issues. These go into `attributes.quality_flags`.

Proposed `attribute_schema` for `ASSET_TYPE = tree` (first version):

```json

  "type": "object",

    "genus":        { "type": ["string", "null"], "description": "Latin genus, e.g. Tilia" },

### Attributes vs. observations from player photos

`@openquest/tree-verification` returns `proposedChanges` for every photo (see [ADR-0005](../adr/0005-tree-assessment-from-player-photos.md)):

- `kind: "attribute"` (condition, vitality, damage, pests, age_class, tree_pit, genus): the **state** of the tree. Becomes an `ATTRIBUTE_CHANGE` with `status = proposed`.
- `kind: "observation"` (phenology, drought_stress, tree_pit_issue, safety_concern): **time stamped facts** that must not overwrite each other, e.g. "flowering on 2026-05-03". They form a history per asset (useful for phenology time series) and fit `ATTRIBUTE_CHANGE` rows with `attribute_key = "observation:<key>"` for now; a dedicated `ASSET_OBSERVATION` table is the cleaner option once the API exists.
- `kind: "new_asset"`: a photographed tree with no inventory tree nearby; a candidate for a new `ASSET` after review.

`requiresReview = true` (always for hazards, dead or missing trees, new assets) means a moderator has to confirm before the change may be accepted or exported to the city.
